# Implementation Summary - Multi-IDE MCP Support

## Changes Made

### 1. **Gradle Configuration** (build.gradle.kts)
- Added JVM arguments to force port 63344 for all sandbox IDEs
- Added system properties for debugging
- This ensures all development IDEs use a consistent port

### 2. **MCP Server Initializer** (McpServerInitializer.kt)
- Created startup activity to log MCP configuration
- Detects sandbox vs production environment
- Logs current port configuration for debugging
- Added health check service placeholder

### 3. **Plugin Configuration** (plugin.xml)
- Registered the startup activity
- Added REST service for health checks
- Cleaned up PHP tool comments (they're loaded via php-support.xml)

### 4. **Documentation** (README.md)
- Added MCP configuration section with clear port assignments:
  - `jetbrains-intellij`: Port 63342 (IntelliJ IDEA production)
  - `jetbrains-phpstorm`: Port 63343 (PhpStorm when IntelliJ is running)
  - `jetbrains-plugin-debug`: Port 63344 (All sandbox IDEs)
- Explained how to run multiple IDEs simultaneously
- Added development configuration instructions

## How It Works

1. **Production Setup**:
   - IntelliJ IDEA runs on port 63342
   - PhpStorm runs on port 63343 (when IntelliJ is also running)
   - Each IDE appears as a separate tool provider in Claude

2. **Development Setup**:
   - All sandbox IDEs (runIde, runPhpStorm, runCommunity) use port 63344
   - This avoids conflicts with production IDEs
   - Developers can test changes while keeping production IDEs running

3. **Port Assignment**:
   - The MCP proxy connects to the specific port based on JETBRAINS_PORT env variable
   - Each configuration in Claude points to a different port
   - No more timeouts or conflicts between IDEs

## Next Steps

1. Test the configuration with all three gradle tasks
2. Verify the MCP endpoints respond correctly on port 63344
3. Enable PHP tools and test in PhpStorm
4. Consider implementing proper MCP endpoint handlers if needed
