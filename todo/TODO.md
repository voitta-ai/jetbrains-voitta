We want to reverse-engineer the project at /Users/gregory.golberg/g/git.voitta/jetbrains-voitta/src/main/resources/SampleJavaProject.

Clear all breakpoints.

Esure we set breakpoints on all lines just before the method exit. That can be last line or throws statement of a void method, or a returns or throws statement of any other method.

Run the project under debug until the first breakpoint is hit. Report when it is hit and await further instructions.
